# Shree

My First Core PHP Project [2018-2019]

## Usage

The easiest way of spinning this project would using the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) included in this project.
Make sure you've docker installed on your system and then just run the following command in this folder:

```sh
docker compose up
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost` with the database also setup.

Upon launching the app you can use following credentials to login:

Username

> `shree@prodevelopers.in`

Password:

> keepsmiling

Have Fun Exploring!
